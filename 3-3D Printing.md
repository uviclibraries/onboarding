1. Please review the following [Workshop on 3D printing](https://uviclibraries.github.io/3d-design-print/){:target="_blank"} 

2. Read the Staff Printing guide here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WWErUqDHkZ28AamaiD-OEPgqqcGV4j3bq1SJS6cPkXA/edit#heading=h.qr0lyvmiwu70](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WWErUqDHkZ28AamaiD-OEPgqqcGV4j3bq1SJS6cPkXA/edit#heading=h.qr0lyvmiwu70){:target="_blank"} 

3. Read the pamphlets on 3D printing at the DSC desk.

4. Browse some 3D prints on [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/){:target="_blank"}  and [printables](https://www.printables.com/model){:target="_blank"}.  Get familiar with the wide array of items and download one or two items you find interesting.

5. Make sure you are able to open and navigate **Cura** on the DSC computer. You should see **5** Ultimaker printers connected (Ada, Brunel, Claudia, Diana, and LittleE), if you do not see all the printers, follow step 6, if all the printers are connected, skip to step 7.
   
6. First, click on the printers you can see on the upper left side of the page, and click on "Manage printers". Next, a pop-up box will appear, click on "Add New", located on the top right corner 

7. Open the files you downloaded and spend some time moving them around, changing the scale, and changing the print settings.
    - If you need help using Ultimaker Cura, the official support page is here: [https://support.makerbot.com/s/topic/0TO5b000000Q4wVGAS/using-ultimaker-cura](https://support.makerbot.com/s/topic/0TO5b000000Q4wVGAS/using-ultimaker-cura){:target="_blank"}
    - Rotate pieces to position them at the optimal orientation!
    - Google is also a great tool!

8. Optional: open and get familiar with **MakerBot** software. The Makerbot printer is older and lower quality so it is generally only used at high volume times.

9. Hands-on training: 
    - practise sending a file to 3D print
    - practise changing the filament in the printers
    - practise removing a completed print from the printbed
    - practise swapping out the glass printbed
    - practise labeling and dropping off a completed print
    - optional: practise removing supports from a print
    - optional: practise Hot & Cold pulls
