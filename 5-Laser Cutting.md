The laser cutter is the DSC's newest piece of equipment.  It can cut or engrave wood, paper, cardboard, and more.  Currently, only full time staff can operate the laser cutter alone.

1. Read the laser cutting FAQ: [https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/dsc/how-to-laser-cut/](https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/dsc/how-to-laser-cut/)

2. Read how to price laser cutting jobs in the web app with Inkscape: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AjjRaYBW3XyI8Syf6feJVh-oIfTr6Jt0sXyDN-XdJWE/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AjjRaYBW3XyI8Syf6feJVh-oIfTr6Jt0sXyDN-XdJWE/edit)

3. Go through the laser cutting workshop: [lib.uvic.ca/lasdes](https://uviclibraries.github.io/laser/)

4. Depending on your position, gain hands-on training to use the laser cutter safely.
    - practise turning the laser cutter and filter on and off
    - practise calibrating the bed height
    - practise uploading a new svg file into Trotec Ruby
    - practise editing, double checking positing, and starting laser cut jobs in Trotec Ruby
    - learn about fire protocols and laser safety (don't look directly at the laser beam)
    - optional: take the Uvic laser safety training course: [https://www.uvic.ca/ohse/training/research-safety/laser-safety/index.php](https://www.uvic.ca/ohse/training/research-safety/laser-safety/index.php)
