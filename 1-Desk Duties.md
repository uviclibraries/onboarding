# DSC Front Desk Duties
The DSC Desk is the first point of contact for students, staff, faculty and community members entering the DSC space.  When working at the desk, your main duties are to direct traffic and answer questions.

1. If you are **first at the desk** for the day:
    - get the DSC desk key from the office cabinet
    - Plug in the telephone
    - Put away the closed sign

2. If you are **last** to leave:
    - put away the phone and lock the desk drawer
    - put away the key in the office cabinet (if you are working after hours and the office is locked, keep the key inside the cabinet)
    - If the waste bin is full dispose of it in the larger bins by the metal DSC signage.  Janitorial staff usually miss the DSC bin when they do their rounds, so please do this regularly.
    - Put up the closed sign

3. Answering questions at the desk:
    - Directions and printing questions are most common.  Make sure you're familiar with major library locations ([https://www.uvic.ca/library/use/floormaps/index.php](https://www.uvic.ca/library/use/floormaps/index.php){:target="_blank"}) and the DSC website [FAQ](https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/dsc/faq/){:target="_blank"}
    - Track your interactions here: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScFA_hQrWr-IlVN0zp_ha9dMO6IJOV1Qsxdu5sQdpiQMRnzLg/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScFA_hQrWr-IlVN0zp_ha9dMO6IJOV1Qsxdu5sQdpiQMRnzLg/viewform){:target="_blank"}  
        - This helps DSC managers know who is busy and the needs of library users
        - If the Audience type is unknown, you can leave it blank
        - Time spent can be a rough best estimate

4. Paper Printing:
    - Instructions for student printing at the library are located above the DSC printers (QR code)
    - **Large Format Printing** is different from normal library print jobs and can't be paid through the normal system.  Instructions are found here: [Google Drive instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rSmanPw3Syy8qlTgIyckcR5QKKcHGdS-/edit){:target="_blank"}

5. Managing the DSC Space:
    - Students are allowed to talk in the DSC area, although the rest of the 3rd floor is silent space.  If volume gets too loud, you can politely remind them that sound travels easily to other areas of the library.
    - Students and faculty can use the special software (Adobe suite and Scanning) computers first-come-first-serve.  Instructions on using the scanner are taped to the top of the scanner.
    - Special equipment (digital calipers, hand tools, etc) can be borrowed and used **In the DSC space**.  Small electronics parts (resistors, sensors, wires etc) are loaned out on the honor system and should be returned as soon as the student is finished using them.  **Raspberry Pi kits** are loaned out from the main library desk.

6. Events and Workshops:
    - The DSC room booking schedule is here: [https://webapp.library.uvic.ca/dscommons/week.php](https://webapp.library.uvic.ca/dscommons/week.php){:target="_blank"}
        - There should also be a paper copy of the week's events posted at both DSC entrances, the template is found here: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pcXJKexWYgPVvqX0vPmUwvSdr3dsn3UYctJPX_Ri0tI/edit#slide=id.p](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pcXJKexWYgPVvqX0vPmUwvSdr3dsn3UYctJPX_Ri0tI/edit#slide=id.p){:target="_blank"}
    - If there is a scheduled workshop or event, place **Reserved** signs on the front tables (or all tables if the whole room is reserved) about 1 hour ahead of scheduled start time.  The overhead projector should show the event and reserved time for the day.
    - The red carpeted corridor leading from the doors next to the DSC desk to the back offices **must be open and clear at all times**.  It is a fire corridor and cannot be blocked or obstructed.
    - After an event, the organizers are responsible for returning tables & chairs to their **original configuration**.  A guide to the default table setup is taped on the wall next to the AV cabinet.
    - A detailed guide to setting up the AV cabinet for hybrid workshops is here (depending on your role you may or may not be responsible for this): [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yevYatroOnBSGE5fmOH2rbSlWUzxJsPy/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yevYatroOnBSGE5fmOH2rbSlWUzxJsPy/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs){:target="_blank"}
        - you can also find a paper copy of this inside the AV cabinet.
