# DSC Front Desk Duties
The DSC Desk is the first point of contact for students, staff, faculty and community members entering the DSC space.  When working at the desk, your main task is to direct traffic and answer questions.

1. If you are first at the desk for the day:
    - get the DSC desk key from the office cabinet
    - Plug in the telephone
    - Put away the closed sign

2. If you are last to leave:
    - put away the phone and lock the desk drawer
    - put away the key in the office cabinet (if you are working after hours and the office is locked, keep the key inside the cabinet)
    - Put up the closed sign

3. Track interactions here: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScFA_hQrWr-IlVN0zp_ha9dMO6IJOV1Qsxdu5sQdpiQMRnzLg/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScFA_hQrWr-IlVN0zp_ha9dMO6IJOV1Qsxdu5sQdpiQMRnzLg/viewform)
    - If the Audience type is unknown, you can leave it blank
    - Time spent can be a rough best estimate.

4. Large Format Printing is different from normal library print jobs.  Instructions are found here: [Google Drive instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rSmanPw3Syy8qlTgIyckcR5QKKcHGdS-/edit)
