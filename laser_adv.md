# How to run laser cut jobs

1. Hands-on training is provided if your position requires using the laser cutter.

2. At any point if the filter unit stops working, smoke will no longer be sucked up. The laser cutter can be stopped in a few ways, with the pause button, the stop button, as well as the emergency stop red button. 

# Maintenance

Like other pieces of equipment, the laser cutter requires regular maintenance, including regular cleaning of the work area. Some of the regular maintenance includes:

1. Cleaning of the working table: The working table is where several small parts often fall during the laser cutting process. This area is covered with a honeycomb raised bed, which reduces burn marks on pieces and provides airflow, reducing the risks of fires. However, since flammable material does fall on the work table, it is important to clean the area regularly. To clean the work table, first remove the honeycomb bed. Use the hand-held vacuum, to remove all small material parts from the bed.
