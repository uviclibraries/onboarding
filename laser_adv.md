# How to run laser cut jobs

1. Hands-on training is provided if your position requires using the laser cutter.

2. At any point if the filter unit stops working, smoke will no longer be sucked up. The laser cutter can be stopped in a few ways, with the pause button, the stop button, as well as the emergency stop red button. 



 <script>  

    function toggle(input) {
        var x = document.getElementById(input);
        if (x.style.display === "none") {
            x.style.display = "block";
        } else {
            x.style.display = "none";
        }
    }
</script>
