# How to run laser cut jobs

1. Hands-on training is provided if your position requires using the laser cutter.

2. At any point if the filter unit stops working, smoke will no longer be sucked up. The laser cutter can be stopped in a few ways, with the pause button, the stop button, as well as the emergency stop red button. 

# Maintenance

Like other pieces of equipment, the laser cutter requires regular maintenance, including regular cleaning of the work area. Some of the regular maintenance includes:

1. Cleaning the working table: The working table is where several small parts often fall during the laser cutting process. This area is covered with a honeycomb raised bed, which reduces burn marks on pieces and provides airflow, reducing the risks of fires. However, since flammable material does fall on the work table, it is important to clean the area regularly. To clean the work table, first remove the honeycomb bed. Use the hand-held vacuum, to remove all small material parts from the bed.

2. Cleaning the lens and mirror: Ruby will frequently indicate if the lens and mirror need to be cleaned. This is important to ensure the accuracy of the cuts and the focus of the laser. When required, cleaning can be done with the lens tissue and the lens cleaner. The laser must be turned **off** when cleaning the lens and mirror for your safety. Carefully remove the mirror by loosening the nob, clean the mirror by making sure to be very gentle, and avoid touching the surface with your fingers. 

3. Disposing of scraps: Boxes are available in the laser cutting room to place any small, unusable pieces left over from previous jobs. When this box is full, Rich can arrange for a pickup.
