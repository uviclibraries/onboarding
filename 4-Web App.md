3D Printing and Laser Cutting requests are submitted via the [DSC Web App https://webapp.library.uvic.ca/3dprint/customer-dashboard.php](https://webapp.library.uvic.ca/3dprint/customer-dashboard.php).
1. If you don't already have an account, create one using your netlink ID.

2. Click 'Create New Print Job' and  read through the submission form.

3. After you are given admin access, you will be able to see the Dashboard by clicking the **Admin Dashboard** button.      <img src="images/3-dashboard menu.png" style="width:800px;" alt="dashboard menu">
    - **Personal Dashboard:** takes you back to the main landing page.
    - **Reports:** shows payment records
    - **Print History:** shows recent activity (not used often)
    - **Manage Printers:** old function, no longer used
    - **Manage Users:** lets you search user contact information

4. The main admin dashboard sorts each job by status: submited, payment pending, paid, printing, completed, and archived.  click on a submitted job to see more information.

5. When a job is submitted, open it and download the file.  Open the file in Cura, then check all of the requested settings. <img src="images/3-download.png" style="margin-left:20px; float:right; width:150px;" alt="dashboard menu">
    - The settings that most often are missed when pricing are the **Number of Copies** and special settings in the **comments box** like colour, sizing, etc.
    - Change settings as needed in Cura, then **Slice** to calculate the price.  PLA is **0.10/gram**, PVA and TPU95 are **80.20/gram**.
    - Enter the price in the web app, set Status to Pending Payment, and click **Save**.

6. If a user submits **multiple files** at the same time, price all items together (unless they request otherwise).
    - when we save a job as 'pending payment' or 'completed', an email is automatically sent to the user.  Since we don't want to send multiple emails for a bundle of prints, make sure to **uncheck Enable Email** at the bottom of the page for every print **other than the one you've priced**.

7. **Staff Notes** box: 
    - this box is for communications between staff members and can only be seen by **Admin** users.  Make notes in this box if there are problems with the print, you're emailed a user, or any other special notes about a specific print.
    - example: 'emailed user about their special requests, do not price yet - Feb 8, Victoria'
    - example: 'multiple files, priced for all 4 items'
    - example: 'no charge for print, see email correspondence'
