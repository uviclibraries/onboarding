- Assist faculty, students, and staff in learning digital tools and methodologies to help them pursue their passions and tell their research stories in engaging ways, in a welcoming, equitable, and diverse environment. 
- Encourage interdisciplinary work across campus in order to spark cross-disciplinary conversations. 
- Offer services to help our UVic community become well-versed in digital information fluency through one-on-one training, workshops, digital curriculum development advice, tools, software, and more.
