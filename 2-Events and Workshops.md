# DSC Events and Workshops

1. The DSC room booking schedule is here: [https://webapp.library.uvic.ca/dscommons/week.php](https://webapp.library.uvic.ca/dscommons/week.php){:target="_blank"}
    - There should also be a paper copy of the week's events posted at both DSC entrances, the template is here: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pcXJKexWYgPVvqX0vPmUwvSdr3dsn3UYctJPX_Ri0tI/edit#slide=id.p](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pcXJKexWYgPVvqX0vPmUwvSdr3dsn3UYctJPX_Ri0tI/edit#slide=id.p){:target="_blank"}

2. If there is a scheduled workshop or event, place **Reserved** signs on the front tables (or all tables if the whole room is reserved) about 1 hour ahead of scheduled start time.  The overhead projector should show the event and reserved time for the day.
    - A detailed guide to setting up the AV cabinet for hybrid workshops is here (depending on your role you may or may not be responsible for setup): [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yevYatroOnBSGE5fmOH2rbSlWUzxJsPy/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yevYatroOnBSGE5fmOH2rbSlWUzxJsPy/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs){:target="_blank"}
        - you can also find a paper copy of this inside the AV cabinet.

3. The red carpeted corridor leading from the doors next to the DSC desk to the back offices **must be open and clear at all times**.  It is a fire corridor and cannot be blocked or obstructed.
    
4. After an event, the organizers are responsible for returning tables & chairs to their **original configuration**.  A guide to the default table setup is taped on the wall next to the AV cabinet.

5. Workshops need to be reviewed frequently. Software interfaces may change, or maybe you have a great idea for a new activity.  Depending on your role you may or may not directly edit workshop content, and everyone can contribute to keeping workshop content up to date.
    - Workshop content can be accessed from the DSC lesson plans page: [https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/dsc/workshops/lessonplans/](https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/dsc/workshops/lessonplans/){:target="_blank"}
