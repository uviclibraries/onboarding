# DSC Events and Workshops

1. The DSC room booking schedule is here: [https://webapp.library.uvic.ca/dscommons/week.php](https://webapp.library.uvic.ca/dscommons/week.php){:target="_blank"}
    - There should also be a paper copy of the week's events posted at both DSC entrances, the template is here: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pcXJKexWYgPVvqX0vPmUwvSdr3dsn3UYctJPX_Ri0tI/edit#slide=id.p](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pcXJKexWYgPVvqX0vPmUwvSdr3dsn3UYctJPX_Ri0tI/edit#slide=id.p){:target="_blank"}

2. If there is a scheduled workshop or event, place **Reserved** signs on the front tables (or all tables if the whole room is reserved) about 1 hour ahead of scheduled start time.  The overhead projector should show the event and reserved time for the day.
    - A detailed guide to setting up the AV cabinet for hybrid workshops is here (depending on your role you may or may not be responsible for setup): [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yevYatroOnBSGE5fmOH2rbSlWUzxJsPy/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yevYatroOnBSGE5fmOH2rbSlWUzxJsPy/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs){:target="_blank"}
        - you can also find a paper copy of this inside the AV cabinet.

3. The red carpeted corridor leading from the doors next to the DSC desk to the back offices **must be open and clear at all times**.  It is a fire corridor and cannot be blocked or obstructed.
    
4. After an event, the organizers are responsible for returning tables & chairs to their **original configuration**.  A guide to the default table setup is taped on the wall next to the AV cabinet.
